My name is Emmanuel Oluwatola. I am embarking on a journey to become a DevOps Engineer with Kavetec Mentorship Class. My expectation is to gain hands-on experience in automation, cloud infrastructure and continous integration at the end of the traineeship. I want to be proficient in optimizing workflows, automating deployments, and managing scalable systems. Few changes has been added.
